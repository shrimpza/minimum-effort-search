# Minimum Effort Search

A simple REST service exposing some RedisSearch functionality to support
simple self-hosted full-text search functionality.

## Runtime Requirements

- Java 17 JRE
- A [RediSearch](https://redis.io/docs/stack/search/) instance to connect to

## Build

The project is built using Gradle and a Java 17 JDK:

```
$ ./gradlew execJar
```

This generates a fat/uber jar in the `build/libs/` directory which may be
used to run the service.

## Configuration and Running

The service and index schema are configured using a simple YAML config file.

A sample file may be generated by simply running:

```
java -jar minimum-effort-search-exec.jar > config.yml
```

The above will write the file `config.yml` with some example parameters which
you may customise.

Thereafter, run the service with the config file as the first parameter:

```
java -jar minimum-effort-search-exec.jar config.yml
```

The service will start up, listening on the port you specifier in the config
file.

`GET /search?q=shirt&limit=10&offset=0`

Parameters:
